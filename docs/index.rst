A Python library to create, parse, modify, and format `MapServer <https://mapserver.org/documentation.html>`_ Mapfiles. 

+ Pure Python - no MapServer dependencies
+ Open Source License (MIT)
+ An official `OSGeo Community Project <https://www.osgeo.org/projects/mappyfile/>`_

An online formatter demonstrating the libraries capabilities can be found at: https://app.mapserverstudio.net/

mappyfile was first introduced in a presentation at `FOSS4G Europe 2017 <https://europe.foss4g.org/2017/Home>`_ - slides are available 
:download:`to download here <_static/foss4ge2017_mappyfile_sgirvin.pdf>`.

Installation
------------

mappyfile is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/mappyfile/>`_ (the Python Package Index), and can be installed using pip.
It requires **Python 3.8** or higher.

.. code-block:: console

    pip install mappyfile

This will also install its required dependencies - `Lark <https://github.com/lark-parser/lark>`__, and 
`jsonschema <https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema>`_. 

To install the optional `lark-cython <https://github.com/lark-parser/lark_cython>`_ library
for better performance on CPython you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install mappyfile[lark_cython]

If lark-cython is installed it will be used automatically. If it is installed and you want to disable its
use in mappyfile you can set the ``MAPPYFILE_USE_CYTHON`` to ``False`` (or any falsy value). 

.. code-block:: console

    # Linux
    export MAPPYFILE_USE_CYTHON="False"

    # Windows PowerShell
    $env:MAPPYFILE_USE_CYTHON="False"

    # Windows Command Line
    set MAPPYFILE_USE_CYTHON=False

mappyfile is also available on `conda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mappyfile>`_. Install as
follows:

.. code-block:: console

    conda install -c conda-forge mappyfile

To setup a Conda environment containing mappyfile from scratch on Windows download
`Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html>`_
and run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    conda create --name mappyfile-env
    conda activate mappyfile-env

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict
    conda install mappyfile --yes

    mappyfile --help

Three command line tools are also available - ``format``, ``validate``, and ``schema``:

.. code-block:: bat

    mappyfile format raster.map formatted_raster.map
    mappyfile validate D:\ms-ogc-workshop\ms4w\apps\ms-ogc-workshop\**\*.map
    mappyfile schema mapfile-schema-8-0.json --version=8.0

What is mappyfile?
------------------

*mappyfile* takes a Mapfile as input and parses it into an `Abstract syntax tree (AST) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree>`_ 
using `Lark <https://github.com/lark-parser/lark>`_ a Python parsing library. 
mappyfile can then transform the AST into a dictionary structure, containing keys and values of dicts, and lists familiar to
Python programmers. This structure can be edited directly. Alternatively new objects can be added by parsing further Mapfile text and 
inserting into the dictionary structure. mappyfile also includes a "pretty printer" to export this dictionary structure back to a 
Mapfile, with keyword formatting and indentation. 

*mappyfile* assumes knowledge of the Mapfile format - a `domain specific language (DSL) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language>`_ used
by MapServer to generate map images. mappyfile is a possible alternative to using MapScript. The definitions of these (from the 
`MapServer glossary <http://mapserver.org/el/glossary.html>`_) are shown below:

+ **Mapfile** is the declarative language that MapServer uses to define data connections, 
  map styling, templating, and server directives. Its format is XML-like and hierarchical, 
  with closing END tags, but the format is not XML.

+ **MapScript** is an alternative to the CGI application of mapserv that allows you to 
  program the MapServer object API in many languages.

The diagram below shows the different elements of mappyfile, and how they are used to modify a Mapfile:

Why?
----

* Easily generate development, staging, and production Mapfiles from the same source Mapfile
* Create Mapfiles for different datasets from a single Mapfile
* Create, manipulate, and test Mapfiles from within Python

The current alternative to building applications with MapServer is to use MapScript. This approach has a
number of issues that resulted in the development of mappyfile:

+ MapScript needs to be compiled using SWIG and a C/C++ compiler
+ You need to create an empty log file or MapServer won't open the map (or get ``msSetErrorFile(): General error message. 
  Failed to open MS_ERRORFILE`` errors)
+ MapScript is only available for Windows on PyPI
+ It is necessary to set the working directory so that MapServer includes are found (this also applies to mappyfile, but there is no need to os.chdir
  and change the working directory for your script or application)
+ The MapScript API is not particularly "Pythonic"

One key difference is that mappyfile only deals with text, so you cannot retrieve features or connect to databases through layers as you can with MapScript. 
mappyfile's approach is to build a Mapfile that then uses the mapserv program to handle these requirements. This design was influenced by Sean Gillies,
the MapScript maintainer for several years (until 2006). A couple of his last blog posts on MapScript make a strong case for working with Mapfiles rather than MapScript:  

    *"Cease, or at the very least, minimize your use of MapServer's various language bindings. 
    Instead, embrace MapServer's domain-specific language (DSL) and write more of the declarative 
    cartographic scripts known as mapfiles. Use the mapserv (or shp2img) program to compile these 
    scripts into images. This is the path to happiness and prosperity."*

    Sean Gillies - `Stop using MapScript`_

A later post listed the benefits of this approach:

    *"the instructions encoded in a MapServer mapfile comprise a domain-specific language..
    to embrace the map language is to benefit from simplicity, usability, and portability."*

    Sean Gillies - `Declarative Maps`_

The concept of the Mapfile as a DSL has been implemented a few times. A Python `Mapfile builder`_ written by Allan Doyle used an XML approach.

More recently the Node module `node-mapserv`_ provides support for declarative mapfile programming. 
As the author notes: 

    *node-mapserv is not MapScript for Node. Instead it provides a simple declarative API for 
    rendering mapserver mapfiles..most of what can be accomplished imperatively 
    using mapscript can be done declaratively by custom generating new mapfiles and tweaking 
    existing mapfiles*

As an interesting footnote the MapScript "bindings" are available in several different languages thanks to `SWIG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIG>`_ which creates wrapper 
code for C. SWIG was developed by `David Beazley <http://www.dabeaz.com/>`_, who then later built `PLY <http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/>`_ on which mappyfile was originally based. 
PLY is an implementation of lex and yacc parsing tools for Python - the tools MapServer itself uses to parse Mapfiles in C. 

Development Roadmap
-------------------

Future development plans include:

+ Setup an easy way to plug in "linters" to check various Mapfile settings and rules (e.g. configured correctly for WFS)
+ Create a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating mappyfile usage
+ Add a plugins page to the docs
+ Add an example of creating Mapfiles using YAML
+ Create a new ``prune`` function to remove redundant default settings from a Mapfile
